# pong-phaser-js-game
A simple pong game using phaser.js

This was built in a day and a half based on a tutorial, and then extending past where the tutorial ended (added sound a basic AI).

You can view this in action at www.rmcd.io/pong-phaser-js-game .

##What works:

The game is playable.

You can control the paddle with the mouse.

The game detects collisions and scores correctly.

##What doesn't work:

The AI is pretty bad, behind the scenes an invisible ball is spawned that the computer paddle is supposed to go to, but the code needs some TLC.
